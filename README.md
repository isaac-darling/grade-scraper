# grade-scraper
A web scraper that would retrieve grades from my high school's grade portal.

## Notes:
(Circa December 2019)  
At the time my friends and I were taking finals, so checking our gradebook became a twice hourly occurence (hyperbole, but the point stands). As an emerging programmer, the repetitive nature of the task bothered me and I decided to automate it. The result was this code, which would look up my grades and write them to a txt file.
